__Mutually Assured Destruction__

The only winning move is... to win?

Summary
	- Each player starts with some number of cities, some number of nukes, and
		some amount of money..
		+ Default to 3 cities and 5 nukes.
		+ Might make city, nuke, and money quantities configurable on new game.
	- Each nuke has an hourly or daily upkeep cost.
		+ No need to make this configurable. It would be equivalent to changing
			starting money.

		upkeep cost.

		all commands and bot announcements.

	- A player can launch a nuke at any target at any time.
	- The launch command is sent to the bot in the group chat and the bot
		announces when the nuke will strike its target (default to 24 hours).
		The bot will probably also makes announcements every few hours. The
		targeted player may still choose to launch a nuke at any time.
		+ Default to 24 hours.
		+ Might make this configurable on new game.
	- When a nuke strikes its target, that city is destroyed.
